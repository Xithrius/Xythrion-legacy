# xythrion-webserver

A webserver which the Xythrion bot can request graphs from.

## development

To reduce time recompiling, you can simply use [cargo watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch) with the command `cargo watch -x 'run --bin xythrion-webserver'` to reload the server every time a change to your code is made and saved.
